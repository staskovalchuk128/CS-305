<h4>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</h4>
Artemis Financial, a financial institution, aims to develop security software to enhance customer protection. This software will mitigate the risk of hackers or attackers gaining unauthorized access to customers' personal information. Additionally, it will ensure that only authorized individuals can access this data.
<h4>What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?</h4>
One positive action I took was conducting vulnerability tests through dependency checks. This process involved reviewing a list of vulnerabilities identified within the code. Maintaining secure code is paramount as it serves as a barrier against unauthorized access by hackers or attackers. Moreover, robust security instills trust in a company's practices, safeguarding sensitive information from being compromised. Failure to secure code can result in personal data breaches, leading to customer attrition and damage to the company's reputation.
<h4>What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?</h4>
One aspect of the vulnerability assessment that proved beneficial was identifying false positives. This process involved discerning vulnerabilities that might not have actually existed. I conducted tests for false positives multiple times, and occasionally, upon re-running the dependency check, the list of vulnerabilities diminished.
<h4>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</h4>
I generated an SSL certificate to ensure secure communication via HTTPS. Employing dependency checks, I assessed vulnerabilities, implementing suppression to test for false positives.
<h4>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</h4>
I ensured the correctness of the code through careful writing and rigorous testing. Utilizing dependency checks, I examined the list of vulnerabilities. Following updates and code refactoring, I conducted another round of dependency checks to identify any new vulnerabilities.
<h4>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
When encountering obstacles, I typically turned to Stackoverflow website to find solutions to my inquiries.</h4>
<h4>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?</h4>
An assignment/project that demonstrates my skills, knowledge, and experience is the Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report.
